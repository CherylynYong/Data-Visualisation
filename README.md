## SQL Scripts

### [MonEquip Data Warehouse](https://github.com/CherylynYong/Data-Visualisation/blob/main/data_warehouse.sql)  
This project involves designing a data warehouse for Monash Equipment Centre (MonEquip), an Australian company providing equipment for construction projects. The warehouse was created to help MonEquip generate Business Intelligence reports, focusing on product sales, equipment hiring, and related business transactions. The goal was to enable faster report generation and trend forecasting.


## R Scripts & Reports

### [Phishing Website Classification](https://github.com/CherylynYong/Data-Visualisation/blob/main/data_preprocessing_modelling.pdf)  
This R project involves building classification models to predict whether a website is legitimate or designed for phishing. The dataset used is a modified version of the PhiUSIIL Phishing data. The goal is to develop models that can identify phishing attempts, which are designed to steal personal data from users.
